## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying tumor samples into malignant or benign categories. KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their neighbors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which includes features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tumor-classification-knn.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd tumor-classification-knn
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have followed the installation steps.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook for the full workflow:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Tumor_Classification_KNN.ipynb
    ```

- Model training and evaluation
- Interpretation of results
- Model deployment

## Use Case: Tumor Classification with KNN
The use case focuses on classifying tumor samples into malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The workflow involves:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Preprocessing the data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Performing EDA with pair plots and PCA
- Training the KNN model and optimizing hyperparameters
- Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Interpreting the results and making predictions
